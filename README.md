# Vive Wireless Info Overlay
A Vive Wireless Adapter temperature monitoring overlay. This is useful if you think your wireless is overheating and you want to see what temperature it's hitting. The wireless outputs two readings mTemperature (mT) and rTemperature (rT) I'm not too sure what theses mean but when my mT was hitting 95 degrees it would crash, but after a fan mod (Thanks Kleus) the temperatures are around 50 degrees and it stopped crashing.

## Usage
1) Download and Unzip the latest release here: https://github.com/Denwa/vive-wireless-info-overlay/releases
2) Run ViveWirelessInfo.exe
3) It should now display the temperature at a 5 second update rate.

## Credits 
Thanks to Kleus Balut for inspiring me to do this with his ViveBatteryInfo overlay that displays useful battery info (which this overlay is compatible with). Check his stuff out here: [See his creations here.](https://kleusbalut.booth.pm/items/969809)

Also thanks to this person, that Kelus linked, who created EasyOpenVROverlayFOrUnity which made it much easier to create my own overlay. [Learn more here.](https://sabowl.sakura.ne.jp/gpsnmeajp/unity/EasyOpenVROverlayForUnity/)
